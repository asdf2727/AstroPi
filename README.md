# AstroPi

This was me and my team's submission for the AstroPi Mission Space Lab experiment organised by ESA.
Our mission aimed to study the magnetic field around earth and see if any corelation can be made between volcanoes and the local magnetic intensity.
All the excel sheets and python code can be found in the repository, along with the report our team made explaining our results.
